<h1>Hello there! 👋</h1>

My name is Kjetil Indrehus! 😎 

🎓 Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Engineering** at [NTNU Gjøvik](https://www.ntnu.no/studier/bidata/cybersikkerhet), where I'm diving deep into the exciting world of technology. 💻 📚

🚀 On my GitHub, you'll find a collection of public repositories that reflect my journey as a student and my passion for coding. I've got repositories for various courses I've taken, as well as some personal projects that I've been tinkering with. Feel free to explore and discover what I've been up to! 😀

📍 To get started, I recommend checking out my pinned repositories, where you'll find some of my standout work and projects that I'm particularly proud of.

💼 Starting from the academic year 2023/24, I have taken up the role of **IT Lead** at [Start Gjøvik](https://startgjovik.no/), where I actively contribute to the organization's technology initiatives.
I'm also proud to have initiated and been the original creator of the website's repository, which you can explore here:
